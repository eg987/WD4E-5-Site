*maybe see if i can disable hover, menu animation, etc. for mvmt option

**I DID a third viewport layout "tablet



from rubric: Is the site well-styled? This is very objective.  It should be difficult to score a high score, but not difficult to receive the majority of the points. It is important that everyone create a unique style sheet, even if using a template or framework. Look for feedback in Week Five to improve your score.

List of things I did do:
3 view ports, contrast and color checking, button hover color change; icons, nav menu 2x with animation






*switched order of hamburger (mobile) and desktop nav to make responsive/mobile first, adapted to min width media queries
	?? should i use <menu> tag within or instead of nav?

NTS: make sure to create tablet view distinct from mobile and desktop views

*<section> tag in html is semantic


**template I'm using is designed backwards from my POV, so I had to inventory all three styles and backwards engineer 
-img size for each prof section

*rationale on .section__pict-container having pix dimensions (is it that that will result in a top-end range for  image size)


7/29/2025: Issue in 1200 view of "experience" section overlaying that above it. 
Add larger space between "about" and "experience"

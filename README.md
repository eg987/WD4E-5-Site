*switched order of hamburger (mobile) and desktop nav to make responsive/mobile first, adapted to min width media queries
	?? should i use <menu> tag within or instead of nav?

NTS: make sure to create tablet view distinct from mobile and desktop views

*<section> tag in html is semantic


**template I'm using is designed backwards from my POV, so I had to inventory all three styles and backwards engineer 
-img size for each prof section

*rationale on .section__pict-container having pix dimensions (is it that that will result in a top-end range for  image size)


7/29/2025: Issue in 1200 view of "experience" section overlaying that above it. 
Add larger space between "about" and "experience"
